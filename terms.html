        <p>You agree that any dispute relating in any way to these TOS or TalkCool, including without limitation your or third parties’ access to or use of TalkCool, will be resolved by binding arbitration as discussed below and not through litigation in any court (except in small claims court if the claim is within the court’s jurisdiction and proceeds on an individual basis). Claims are subject to arbitration, regardless of what theory they are based on or whether they seek legal or equitable remedies. Arbitration applies to any and all such claims or disputes, whether they arose in the past, may currently exist, or may arise in the future. This arbitration agreement is entered into pursuant to the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§1-16 (FAA).<br>
          <br>
          YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO OPT OUT OF THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE IF YOU TELL US WITHIN 60 DAYS OF YOUR FIRST DOWNLOAD OR USE OF TalkCool THAT YOU WANT TO OPT OUT. IF YOU WANT TO OPT OUT, SEND A WRITTEN NOTICE ADVISING US OF YOUR DECISION. UNLESS YOU OPT OUT OF ARBITRATION, YOU ARE WAIVING THE RIGHT TO HAVE A DISPUTE HEARD BEFORE A JUDGE OR JURY, OR OTHERWISE TO BE DECIDED BY A COURT OR GOVERNMENTAL TRIBUNAL.<br>
          <br>
          YOU AGREE NOT TO (1) SEEK TO PROCEED ON ANY CLAIM IN ARBITRATION AS A CLASS CLAIM OR CLASS ACTION OR OTHER COMPARABLE REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING; (2) SEEK TO CONSOLIDATE IN ARBITRATION ANY CLAIMS INVOLVING SEPARATE CLAIMANTS; (3) BE PART OF, OR BE REPRESENTED IN, ANY CLASS ACTION OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION BROUGHT BY ANYONE ELSE; NOR (4) SEEK ANY AWARD OR REMEDY IN ARBITRATION AGAINST OR ON BEHALF OF ANYONE WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY TO THE ARBITRATION. IF THESE TERMS RELATING TO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEDURES ARE LEGALLY UNENFORCEABLE FOR ANY REASON, THEN THIS AGREEMENT TO ARBITRATE WILL BE INAPPLICABLE TO THAT CLAIM, AND THAT CLAIM WILL INSTEAD BE HANDLED THROUGH LITIGATION IN COURT RATHER THAN BY ARBITRATION. NO ARBITRATOR SHALL HAVE AUTHORITY TO ENTERTAIN ANY CLAIM ON BEHALF OF A PERSON WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY, NOR SHALL ANY ARBITRATOR HAVE AUTHORITY TO MAKE ANY AWARD FOR THE BENEFIT OF, OR AGAINST, ANY PERSON WHO IS NOT A NAMED PARTY.<br>
          <br>
          Arbitration under these TOS and the Privacy Policy shall be conducted by a single arbitrator under the then current rules of the American Arbitration Association (AAA) or JAMS, at the election of the party filing a claim in arbitration. That organization will apply its rules in effect at the time the arbitration claim is filed. If there is a conflict between those rules and this arbitration provision, this arbitration provision and the TOS will control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any current or future such rules or governing law, the arbitrator shall have no power to vary the terms of the TOS or to award either party attorneys’ fees. In the event that JAMS or the AAA is unable to handle the arbitration for any reason, then the matter shall be arbitrated by a neutral arbitrator selected by agreement of the parties, pursuant to the AAA rules of procedure.<br>
          <br>
          The arbitrator’s award shall be binding and may be entered as a judgment in any court of competent jurisdiction.<br>
          <br>
          We will pay any costs that are required to be paid by us under the arbitration administrator’s rules. Even if not otherwise required, we will reimburse you up to $500 for any initial arbitration filing fees that you have paid. We will also pay any fees of the arbitrator and the arbitration administrator for the first two days of any hearing. If you win the arbitration, we will reimburse you for any fees you paid to the arbitration organization and/or arbitrator. All other fees will be allocated according to the arbitration administrator’s rules and applicable law. If you are unable to afford any fees that you would otherwise be required to pay, you may request us to pay or reimburse them, and we will consider your request.<br>
          <br>
          Arbitration hearings will take place in the federal judicial district that includes your address at the time the arbitration is filed.<br>
